Faster scripts to manage go git projects

## GGIT IS NOT MEANT FOR PUBLIC USE

I've noticed i spend a lot of time doing the same
commands for creating repositories and uploading changes.

This project aims to solve this issue:
- ggit init # create repository
- ggit # upload changes

Have in mind it's dead simple and not recommended
for collaborative environments.
